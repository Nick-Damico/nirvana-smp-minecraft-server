                <p> The time to start testing Nirvana-SMP server is coming up quick, and our major concerns going into the beta testing are stability, connectivity, and latancy. Opening day will be Wednesday Feb. 4th followed by Saturday Feb. 7th starting @5am EST.</p>
                <p> During this beta test the server will have intermitten hours of uptime. We are going to start with two 24hr days for the first week or two, and more days will be added as we feel that we are able to properly handle server load. </p>
      <p>I will be going through the whitelist applications and adding approved players to my friends list, but there is going to be a cut off day for this beta test which will be Jan. Sunday 25th, so if you are wanting to get in on the beta run make sure to complete and submit the whitelist app by then. Obviously since my account will need to be logged in at all times for the server to run that will leave 7 of the 8 player spots availiable so please take that into consideration when trying to join.</p>
      <p>Also if you are going to be bothered by possible interrupted gameplay and other unforseen problems then please sit out this initial test until we can get a handle on any problems that will come up.</p>
      <p>I'm really excited to get this server up and I look forward to playing with everyone in Feb.</p>
